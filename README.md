# Thrive_Together
Platform for self-help groups to promote their product and improve the employment rate.

This project involves real-time analysis, and it began with a visit to the "PUDUVOYAL" nearby communities.
Women in this hamlet were informed about self-help groups so they could use their time to earn extra money for their families.
After conducting research and analysis utilising design thinking techniques, the project began to take off.

The project showcases how we were able to apply our real-time insights and the overall results of this awareness camp.
